## Why is it named obamium?

My car is named obamacar. Come see its [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/2008_lexus_rx350_awd/)

### Info about files

The board files are made with EasyEDA and were exported from EasyEDA. Unfortunately, I am not a KiCad user (yet) so I don't know whether or not you can convert to KiCad reliably. Go ahead, try it out, I don't care

Versions 1 and 2 share the same codebase, while version 3 has no code because it never worked :( However, version 4 got a complete rewrite with a somewhat-better version, using interrupts and states and cool stuff idk
